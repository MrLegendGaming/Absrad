# Absrad


## What is Absrad?
Absrad, is an application which can be used to verify whether a certain Minecraft Modification (mod) has a `Session ID Stealer` or not. It was solely created due to the increasing problem in Hypixel Skyblock mods stealing people's `Session IDs` causing the vicitim to lose weeks, months and even years of hard work.

## How does Absrad work?
The program takes whatever mod you place into it and decompiles it. Following that, it searches all of the code if it has a certain code block which is used to steal your `Session ID`.

> NOTE: Absrad currently only works with Forge mods.

## Why is the code public?
If any other other developers have any changes or additions to be added they can see the code and perform a pull request for it to be added into the official Application. Additionally, if anyone spots any potential exploits in the program which can allow mods to bypass it they can submit a pull request or inform me regarding it.

## How do I know I can trust this application?
Well, it's quite simple. The code is left public for anyone to see and if you believe it may not be safe, you can always send it to any other developer you know to check if it is.
